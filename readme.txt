Practice work

3D game made with Unity engine as a part of studies. This directory only contains the parts of code that I have made myself and it is not a complete Unity project. The programming is done in C#.

The game uses mostly Unity stock assets and some free public domain assets. The playable characters are stock Unity characters. There are two levels in the game. 

One level contains a humanoid character that has to dodge giant balls in an arena like area and at the same time collect boxes. When time advances, more balls are spawned in the arena. Player score is calculated from game time and amount of boxes he has managed to collect.

Second level contains a ball character that has to roll through a track without falling into the sea below. It also features an enemy ball that tries to push the character ball off the track.
